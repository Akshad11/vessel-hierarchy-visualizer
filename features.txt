Application Features List:

1. Hierarchical Data Visualization
   - Visualizes complex vessel data in a structured, multi-level tree diagram.
   - Levels: System -> Equipment Type -> Equipment -> Assembly -> Component.

2. Interactive Canvas
   - Infinite Panning: Move around the tree freely.
   - Smooth Zooming: Zoom in/out using mouse wheel or UI controls.
   - Fit-to-View/Reset: One-click controls to reset the view to the default position.

3. Node Interaction & Management
   - Expand/Collapse: Toggle visibility of child nodes.
   - Accordion Mode: Optional mode to automatically collapse sibling branches when opening a new one.
   - Selection: Click to select nodes and highlight their specific path.
   - Drag & Drop: Reorganize the tree structure by dragging nodes to new parents.

4. Search & Navigation
   - Global Search: Real-time filtering by node name.
   - Smart Highlighting: Highlights matching nodes and dims unrelated ones.
   - Auto-Correction: Automatically expands the tree to reveal search results.
   - Breadcrumbs: Top-bar navigation showing the path to the currently selected node.

5. Visual System & Styling
   - Distinct Node Types: Color-coded styling for System (Blue), Equipment Type (Red), Equipment (Purple), Assembly (Grey), and Component (Green).
   - State Variants: Visual distinction between Active (Solid colors) and Inactive (Light/Opacity reduced) nodes based on selection.
   - Draft Status: Visual indicator for nodes marked as 'Draft'.
   - Dynamic Connections: Curved SVG lines connecting parent and child nodes.

6. Data Management
   - Multi-Dataset Support: Dropdown to switch between various mock datasets (Simple, Moderate, Complex, Very Complex, Ultra Complex).
   - In-memory State: Local state management for immediate feedback during interactions.
